"Air & Noise Pollution Detection System" is the project for the CSE 3118 Microprocessor & Microcontroller Lab. In this project, we have used an Arduino Uno along with a Wi-Fi module, Sound Sensor (LM393), Gas Sensor (MQ-135), LCD display, and a power source to operate the components. Our project can detect the levels of air and noise pollution using the sensors and display the values on the LCD. If any value exceeds the defined threshold, an LED light will turn on, and an alert message will be shown on the display.
